Side "bar graphs"?

"Circular" center visualizer node, consisting of groups of samples. Maybe groups of three or four? In total, the "bar" is drawn by doing a punch of lines, their peaks being made by iterating 
the four samples in each section. So its not always flat ended, but gives a more spiky bar. Get a number of samples divisible by 4. draw straight away from the center in the amount 

Can have "stars" emanating from the center point





MOTION TRACKING IDEAS
IF ANY MOTION TRACKING, SET IT TOO BE OPTIONAL

-Area for motion tracking hand to increase gain?
-use of head tracking to display location of central visualizer
-Or maybe with this, have like a "headbang" mode that increases the gain/effect on song based on head/hand movement?
